    -------
    
    So far, I found a model for spruces developed in Sweden:
    https://academic.oup.com/forestry/article/95/5/634/6580516#375802885
    https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1605781/FULLTEXT01.pdf
    
    and another model developed for Norway using the Norwegian national forest inventory data from NIBIO
    https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21580103.2014.957354
    
    The two models differ a bit, and it is plausible: allometric equations are not general relations but depends
    on the geographical area.  Here we use the Norwegian model.

    Calculate the gap coefficient for every tree inside the corridor (passed as input).
